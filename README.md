# RideAlong
This project was made for the HackSTX 2019 hackathon transportation category. 

Its purpose was to give Rio Grande Valley students that did not have rides to and from each of the different University Campuses a chance
to catch a ride with someone that was going to the same place. 
How it works is that the Rider logs into the app and sends a request for a ride to a specified location from their current location. 
Drivers that are logged in would be notified that someone is looking for a ride to the same location they are going to, or at least near
their destination. The Driver then has the option to accept the request or deny it.

The app was made with the Java programming language in Android Studio and utilizes the Google Maps API.
